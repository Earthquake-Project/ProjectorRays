# ProjectorRays

ProjectorRays is an experimental Lingo decompiler for Macromedia Director/Shockwave movies.

## How do I use it?

The only dependency besides the standard library is Boost. Once you have this, run `make` and then `./projectorrays [path to .dir file]`

ProjectorRays will output `.lingo` files with guessed source code in the current working directory.

Once the project is more stable, a pre-built GUI application will be available.
